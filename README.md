# Telia TV Keyboard Shortcuts (Chrome Extension)

![](project-logo-teliatv-shortcuts.png)

## UPDATE Nov 2021

This functionality is now provided natively by the TeliaTV web player so this extension is no longer needed. I'll keep the repository here for a reference sake.

## Introduction

Telia TV is a streaming service with one annoying feature: it doesn't support using `m` key to mute nor `f` key to toggle fullscreen like almost any other player in the web these days.

I built this unpacked (at least until I can fix all the issues) Chrome extension to solve that problem.

(PS. You might recognize the similarities with my [Viaplay Keyboard Shortcuts project](https://github.com/hamatti/viaplay-keyboard-shortcuts) because I mostly copy-pasted the code and changed the CSS classes).

## How to use?

It's currently an unpacked extension so [download this](https://github.com/Hamatti/teliatv-keyboard-shortcuts/archive/master.zip) and unzip it into a folder. Then open your Google Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable Developer mode from the toggle and select "Load unpacked" and navigate to the folder you unzipped it into.

Now whenever you navigate to [tv.telia.fi](https://tv.telia.fi) and start playing a video, the new keyboard shortcuts will be available.

## Note

Please note that this extension is not affiliated, endorsed or supported by Telia or Telia TV. It is a hobby project built by a user.
